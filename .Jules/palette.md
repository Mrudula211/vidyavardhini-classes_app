## 2024-07-24 - Missing Semantic Labels on Icon Buttons
**Learning:** This Flutter application frequently uses `IconButton` for navigation (Back) and password toggling (Show/Hide) without providing the `tooltip` property. This causes an accessibility issue as screen readers cannot announce the button's purpose, and desktop/web users don't get hover context.
**Action:** Always include a descriptive `tooltip` property on `IconButton` and other icon-only interactive widgets (e.g., `tooltip: 'Show password'`) to ensure full semantic labeling and hover support across all platforms.

## 2026-08-25 - Improve Contrast on Destructive Actions
**Learning:** Destructive actions with a `backgroundColor: Colors.red` on `ElevatedButton` might not have sufficient text contrast if the foregroundColor is not explicitly set, particularly depending on the app theme defaults.
**Action:** Always specify `foregroundColor: Colors.white` when using red backgrounds for warnings/destructive buttons to ensure accessibility and readability.

## 2026-08-26 - Missing tooltips on interactive icon-only buttons
**Learning:** Found an icon-only `IconButton.filled` used for sending chat messages that was missing a tooltip. Icon-only buttons must have tooltips or semantic labels for accessibility, otherwise screen readers won't know what they do.
**Action:** Ensure all `IconButton`, `IconButton.filled`, and `FloatingActionButton` widgets have meaningful `tooltip` properties.

## 2026-08-26 - Missing Semantic Wrappers on Custom Interactive Cards
**Learning:** This Flutter application uses custom interactive widgets like `InkWell` and `GestureDetector` for major navigation flows (e.g., dashboard and role cards). Without explicit accessibility tags, screen readers cannot properly announce these elements as buttons or provide context about their destination.
**Action:** Always wrap the outer `Material`, `InkWell`, or `Card` widget of custom interactive elements acting as buttons in a `Semantics` widget with `button: true`, a clear `label`, and a descriptive `hint` (e.g., `hint: 'Navigate to $title'`) to ensure full accessibility.

## 2026-08-27 - Form Pickers and FABs lack accessibility traits
**Learning:** Custom form elements like photo and date pickers built with `GestureDetector` lack native accessibility metadata, making them completely invisible or confusing to screen readers in Flutter. Additionally, `FloatingActionButton.extended` widgets do not inherit default tooltips when `label` and `icon` are provided, which hinders hover context and screen reader narration.
**Action:** Always wrap `GestureDetector` used for interaction in `Semantics(button: true, label: ..., hint: ...)` and explicitly define the `tooltip` property on all `FloatingActionButton.extended` widgets.
